2. Imported the Excel file into PowerBI
3. Transforming the dataset by adding new columns such as date(transformed) to make it easier to work with
4. Loading this transformed data into PowerBI

### Visualizations(PowerBI)
1. KPI Cards showing total layoffs and average monthly layoffs
2. Slicers to filter data by year, country and industry
3. Line chart showing layoffs over time
